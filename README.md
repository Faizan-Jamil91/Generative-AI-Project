# Interactive Streamlit App for LLM Exploration and Fine-Tuning

## Overview
This project is a Streamlit-based application designed to explore various advanced AI techniques, including prompt exploration, fine-tuning, model distillation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The app also includes features for data visualization to analyze and display results effectively.

## Features
- **Interactive Prompt Exploration**: Experiment with different prompts and language model parameters using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Fine-Tuning for Sentiment Analysis**: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the IMDb dataset to classify sentiment.
- **Model Distillation**: Demonstrate how to distill a smaller, faster DistilBERT model from a larger BERT model.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine information retrieval with language model generation to enhance response relevance.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Collect and simulate the integration of user feedback to refine model outputs.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate multi-chart visualizations, including histograms and box plots, to explore data distributions and statistics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- An OpenAI API key (stored in a `.env` file)
